- Expression bar plots with statistical annotations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proteomics-analysis-platform.git
cd proteomics-analysis-platform
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Setup

### Required Dependencies
Core dependencies are managed through `pyproject.toml` and include:
- streamlit>=1.43.1
- pandas>=2.2.3
- numpy>=2.2.3
- matplotlib>=3.10.1
- plotly>=6.0.0
- scipy>=1.15.2
- seaborn>=0.13.2
- openpyxl>=3.1.5

### Additional Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- statsmodels (for statistical analysis)

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

3. Follow the intuitive workflow:
   - Upload your proteomics data
   - Configure analysis parameters
   - Explore visualizations and results

## Streamlit Configuration

The application uses a custom Streamlit configuration located in `.streamlit/config.toml`:
```toml
[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5000

[theme]
primaryColor = "#0066cc"
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f0f2f6"
textColor = "#262730"
```

This configuration ensures:
- Proper server setup for both local and deployed environments
- Consistent theming across the application
- Accessibility from external networks when deployed
