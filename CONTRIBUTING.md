# Contributing to Proteomics Data Analysis Platform

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin:
1. Install Python 3.11 or higher
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Familiarize yourself with Streamlit's architecture
4. Set up your local development environment

### Local Development

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## Testing

### Running Tests

Before submitting your changes, ensure:

1. All statistical functions produce valid results
2. Data processing maintains data integrity
3. Visualizations render correctly
4. User interface remains responsive

### Test Data

When testing:
- Use small, representative datasets
- Include edge cases in your test data
- Document any assumptions about input data
- Verify memory usage with larger datasets

## Code Style

Please follow these coding standards:

1. Use type hints for function parameters
2. Include docstrings for all functions
3. Follow PEP 8 guidelines
4. Keep functions focused and modular
5. Add comments for complex algorithms

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the project's styling guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Before submitting:

1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Consider if it fits the project's scope
3. Provide clear use cases
4. Describe expected behavior
5. Suggest implementation approach if possible
